VWolt EV Maintenance Scheduler and Guide
The "VWolt EV Maintenance Scheduler and Guide" is a comprehensive digital solution tailored to the unique needs of electric vehicle (EV) owners. As electric mobility gains momentum, it's crucial for EV owners to have a simplified and efficient way to manage their vehicles' maintenance and overall well-being. Unlike traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, EVs have distinct maintenance requirements and complexities. This app provides a user-friendly, all-in-one platform designed to streamline the entire maintenance journey for EV owners.

Key Features
Customized Maintenance Scheduling: The app begins by gathering information about your EV's make and model, using this data to create a personalized maintenance schedule based on the manufacturer's recommendations. Users can view upcoming maintenance tasks and receive automated reminders, ensuring they never miss a critical service appointment.

DIY Maintenance Guides: Recognizing that many EV owners are tech-savvy and enjoy hands-on maintenance, the app provides step-by-step guides and tutorials for common DIY tasks. From changing cabin air filters to checking tire pressure, users can access detailed instructions, images, and even video demonstrations.

Battery Health Monitoring: One of the core features of the app is its ability to monitor the health of the EV's battery. It provides real-time data on the battery's state of charge (SoC) and state of health (SoH). If any issues or irregularities are detected, the app alerts the user and offers recommendations on how to address them. This feature is crucial for prolonging the battery's lifespan and optimizing range.

Maintenance History Tracking: Users can maintain a digital log of all past maintenance and repairs performed on their EV. This digital history includes details such as service dates, costs, and the service center's information. Keeping a comprehensive maintenance history can enhance the resale value of the EV and serve as a reference for future service needs.

Vehicle Registration: The app allows users to register their EV by providing essential details like make, model, registration number, VIN, year of manufacture, color, and mileage.

Profile and Settings: Personalize your experience by accessing your profile settings and customizing app preferences.
